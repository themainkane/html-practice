        <h3>What is the difference between <strong>HTML and CSS?</strong></h3>
        <p>
          In the broad classisifications of coding / web development, (front-end
          and back-end). <a href="#">HTML</a> and <a href="">CSS</a> are both
          concerned with the front end or the 'client side'. They both deal with
          the information provided by a web page, but they are not the same
          thing:
        </p>
        <h5 id="summary_html">HTML</h5>
        <p>
          HTML deals with the actual content of the page, and 'marks up' or
          displays precisely what the developer, or thier client needs to
          communicate. In my case, that is the nuances of html and CSS.
          <br />
        </p>

        <p>
          This is acheived by grouping different snippets of information
          together into things called elements. Simply defined as some
          information or 'content' enclosed between specific tags. The tags are
          there to help the client to display that information correctly. The
          image below provides and example of what this looks like from the
          actual code for this website!
        </p>
        <img
          class="double_size center"
          src="img/Screenshot 2023-09-06 135306.jpg"
          alt="a section of code between header tags"
        />

        <h5>CSS</h5>
        <p>
          So, what exactly is left for CSS to do? Well, the way that information
          is displayed is often atleast as important as the actual content. And
          that is where CSS comes in. CSS stands for Cascading
          <em>Syle</em> Sheets. As the name suggests, it is the styling of a
          webpage that is the wheelhouse of CSS. Anything from pictures to
          <em class="colorful">different font colours,</em
          ><em class="biggy"> and sizes, </em
          ><em class="bg_color">different background colours</em> and much more!

          coding languages are updated periodically to add new levels of
          functionality to ensure progession alongside other wings of the
          industry. Alough sometimes it is neccessarry to remove fucntionality
          too, as was the case when HTML5 was born of its predeccessor

          Many HTML elements will be used over and over again, the five most

        </p>
        <ul>

          </li>
          <li>
            <em class="elements">&lt;li&gt;</em> used for every list item, like

          What is the difference between <strong>semantic</strong> and
          <strong>non-semantic</strong> elements?
        </h3>
        <p>
          A semantic tag is essentially a tag that contains some meaning, it is
          useful for us as humans since we can immeditaely get an idea of the
          content of that element, even without any previous knowledge of
          coding! See if you can infer meaning from some examples below:
        </p>
        <ul class="mini_list">
          <li>&lt;header&gt;</li>
          <li>&lt;footer&gt;</li>
          <li>&lt;table&gt;</li>
          <li>&lt;form&gt;</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          A non-sematic element is precisely the opposite, as in, the tag gives
          us no indiction of the content, examples are &lt;div&gt; and
          &lt;span&gt;.

          Put simply, no. <br />
          Not all elements by individual browsers, this can mean that the use of
          new elements will affect how or whether the information is displayed
          for the client.

          Can I use is website that allows you to compare the compatitbility of
          different elements in different browsers, follow the link above to try
          it for yourself, you should get something that looks a little like
          this....
